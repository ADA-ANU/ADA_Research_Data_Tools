## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

== Before you start ==
### 1. The first thing is to set up an R code environment.

#### 1.1. For Windows User:
* Please instal R in your computer: see [RCAN](https://cran.r-project.org). And click **Download R for Windows** -> **install R for the first time** and install the R base distribution.

* Download an integrated development environment (IDE), Rstudio for example, Go to [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), and install Rstudio Desktop. You can also install jupyter notebook for R.

*Please note that Anaconda may not have the latest version for R and Rstudio, which will cause package install failure.*


### 2. Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need the following dependencies, version of R is **4.2.1**, Lower version of R may cause incompatible error:

```R
library(haven);             # Imports and export SPSS (.sav) data
library(labelled);          # Calls value label, variable label and other information of the data
library(tidyverse);         # Managing data files with a better representation  
library(dplyr)              # Managing the functions using pipes %>%
library(flextable);         # To create tables with merged rows for designated columns
library(officer);           # To incorporate some of the microsoft 
library(stringr);           # contains operators to string and characters
library(sjlabelled)         # Supports 'rename_at', 'var_labels' and 'add_value_labels' functions
library(foreign)            # Imports and export SPSS (.sav) data
library(car)                # To recode or group values
library(reshape2)           # To reshape metrix
library(gmodels)            # Various R Programming Tools for Model Fitting
library(epiDisplay)         # For data exploration and result presentation
```
you can install them by using:


```R
install.packages(c('haven','labelled','tidyverse','dplyr','flextable','officer','stringr','sjlabelled','foreign','car','reshape2','gmodels','epiDisplay'))
```
It¬¥s important to check for packages updates. It¬¥s in tool `menu`->`check for package updates`->`choose the packages`. If you got Error: package or namespace load failed because of the out of updated library,such as 'htmltools', 'vctr'

### 3. Setup

After you copied the data archive folder to your archivist folder, Clone this repository to Processing folder under Dataset folder:

For example: **Download** the whole repository and extract at your working folder



### 4. Pipline

#### 0.  Shell dataset and processing report
Archive work flow, Before this, you already recived data from depositor, and got a consent for ADA processing report for ADA facilitated dataset, For more infomation refer [Shell Dataverse wiki](https://wiki.ada.edu.au/index.php/Creation_of_%27Shell_Dataverse_and_Dataset%27), [Data Processing Wiki](https://wiki.ada.edu.au/index.php/Data_Processing). Generating Data quality checks, Data confidentiality checks and Data frequency documents for identifying different kinds of issues.

#### 1. Process the data 
neither by R or SPSS according to the ADA processing report, and save the Restricted version of data

#### 2. Anoumity the restricted data
Using `Confidentialisation LinA report_General.Rmd`, or `Confidentialisation of LinA data Shorter.sps`  to anoumity the restricted data, and save the General release data.


- `Confidentialisation LinA report_General.Rmd` :   
    - Remember to change title and author, and date before Knit the Confidentialisation report.
    - Please note that be careful with folder structure,
    
    ```R
    library (haven)
    source("../Lib/DPtool.R")
    source("../Lib/linaconf.R")
    ```
    - There are 19 parameters (0.0.1 release) in argparse you can define, they are:
    
    `file_path`: restricted .sav data to confidentialise.
    
    `p_gender_name_ori`:gender variable name in the original data or you defined in restricted during processing.
    
    `p_gender_name`: gender variable name saved to the confidentialised data
    
    `p_age_group_name_ori`: age group variable name in the original data or you defined in restricted during processing.
    
    `p_age_group_name`: age group variable name saved to the confidentialised data
    
    `p_education_name_ori`: education variable name in the original data or you defined in restricted during processing.
    
    `p_education_name`: education variable name saved to the confidentialised data.
    
    `p_state_name_ori`: state variable name in the original data or you defined in restricted during processing.
    
    `p_state_name`: state variable name in the original data or you defined in restricted during processing.
    `missing_value_in_original` recode 'refuse, unknown,don't know, unable to establish, invalid,other'  to argpase@missing_label
    
    `missing_value_in_original_gender` as above, but in LinA panel data, 'other' somehow was recoded 3 May need append 3 in the end.
    
     `missing_value_in_original_gender` as above, but in LinA panel data, 'other' somehow was recoded 3 May need append 3 in the end.
     
     `missing_value_in_original_education`as above, but in social cohesion data, 'other' somehow was recoded as 11.
     
     `missing_value_in_original_age` in case there are any exeptional case. set as missing_value_in_original for now
     
     `missing_value_in_original_state` in case there are any exeptional case. set as missing_value_in_original for now

    
    
    `missing_value`: confidentialised value that saved to the general release data, usually be -97
    
    `missing_label`: confidentialised value that saved to the general release data, usually be 'Unknown' or 'Don't not/Refused'
    
    `max_iteration`: the number of the iterations that do the k-anonymity
    
    `rm_var`: variable names that will be removed in the confidentialised data. basically will be p_\[var\]_ori
    
    `save_spss_filepath`: Path to save confidentialised data, Leave it empty if you don't want to save
    
    `save_sas_filepath`: save SAS, recommended to use SPSS to save. Can't find a founction to save varfile of SAS.
    
    `save_csv_filepath`:Save as CSV, recommended to use R to save, `copy_tool.sps` cannot save .csv properly
    
    `save_dta_filepath` : Save as dta, no recommendation.
    - Then run the every R code section/cell or knit to generate a report.
  
#### 3. Save other format
Use **copy_tools.sps** to save other format such as SAS STATA CSV. (You can also save these format at R syntax in step 1 and 2)
